# Team 26 Final Project

## Developers
1. Make sure to use our git commit message template when possible

```
# Title: Type of commit (issue adressed), Summary, imperative, start upper case, don't end with a period
# No more than 50 chars. #### 50 chars is here:  #

# Remember blank line between title and body.

# Body: Explain *what* and *why* (not *how*).
# Wrap at 72 chars. ################################## which is here:  #
```

2. Make sure to follow our cipipeline when possible. I.e. create an issue and feature for each task. From there, automated checks make sure you can't do anything else wrong.
3. Source files are present in the `src` directory.
4. Test files are present under `cypress/{e2e,component,unit}`
5. Use `npm run docs` for generating documentation (locally) and `npm test` for running tests (in headless mode)
